# RIXSTool

This is a set of scripts for Igor Pro 9

The folders should be in ~/Documents/WaveMetrics/Igor Pro 9 User Files/User Procedures/

You'll also need two XOPs:
- JSON-XOP, which can be found here: https://docs.byte-physics.de/json-xop/ The XOP itself should live in ~/Documents/WaveMetrics/Igor Pro 9 User Files/Igor Extensions (64-bit)/
- RIXSTool_XOP same folder as above. (Contact me)
